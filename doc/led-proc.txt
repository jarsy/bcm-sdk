			 BCM56xx LED Processor
		       by Curt McDowell 08/09/02

1) LED Processor

The LED Processor is featured in the BCM5605 and later StrataSwitch
chips, as well as all StrataXGS switch and fabric chips.  It is a very
simple, tiny 8-bit CPU integrated into the CPU Management Interface
Controller (CMIC) portion of the chip.  The processor is very
well-matched to the task of managing LEDs, but does not have enough
power or capacity to perform additional functions.

Downloading the LED Processor program, and subsequent communication
between the LED Processor and the host device, is done via direct-mapped
PCI memory accesses into the LED Processor program and data space.

The net output of the LED Processor are two pins, clock and data, that
output a scan chain of 0's and 1's into a series of external shift
registers connected to LEDs.  The layout and length of the LED chain is
completely dependent on board implementation, so if the customer LED
chain is not the same as one of the existing SDK chains, then a custom
program is needed.

The entire LED Processor program runs from start to completion
approximately 30 times per second, providing a maximum update rate of
30Hz.  Little or no host CPU intervention is required, however the host
CPU can always information to the LED Processor by writing into its data
space.

2) LED Processor Resources

Starting in SDK 2.0.0 and later, the $SDK/led directory in the top
level of the release tree contains PDF documentation, tools including
assembler, disassembler, and debugger, and numerous sample programs for
existing Broadcom SDK boards.

On Broadcom SDK systems, the rc.soc initialization script starts a
default program running on the LED Processor where appropriate.
The rc.soc script is located in

	$SDK/rc/rc.soc

and rc.soc is also commonly programmed on the CPU flash filesystem as:

	flash:rc.soc

For example, the source code for the default LED program for BCM5605,
BCM5615, and BCM5645 SDKs is called "sdk5605.asm" and is located in:

	$SDK/led/example/sdk5605.asm
	$SDK/led/example/sdk5605.hex	(assember output file)

3) Developing LED Programs

A LED program can be written or modified by the programmer to present
other behaviors.

In general, to try a new program the user should assemble the source
code and test-load the program using the BCM commands:

	led stop
	led load my_prog.hex
	led start

Once a program is developed, the program's .hex data can be used to
replace the one in rc.soc for custom behavior, or can be passed as a
byte array to the soc_ledproc_config() routine in the driver library.

4) An example SDK LED Program for BCM5605

The BCM5605 SDK has 14 columns of 4 LEDs each as shown below:

	Lxx  L25  L01 L03 L05 L07 L09 L11 L13 L15 L17 L19 L21 L23
	Lxx  A25  A01 A03 A05 A07 A09 A11 A13 A15 A17 A19 A21 A23
	Lxx  L26  L02 L04 L06 L08 L10 L12 L14 L16 L18 L20 L22 L24
	Lxx  A26  A02 A04 A06 A08 A10 A12 A14 A16 A18 A20 A22 A24

Lxx are voltage status LEDs and are not accessible.

The sdk5605.asm program writes bits to the LED scan chain in the proper
order in order to implement the following behavior (see sdk5605.asm for
detailed information):

L01 reflects port 1 link status:
	Black: no link
	Amber: 10 Mb/s
	Green: 100 Mb/s
	Alternating green/amber: 1000 Mb/s
	Very brief flashes of black at 1 Hz: half duplex
	Longer periods of black: collisions in progress

A01 reflects port 1 activity (even if port is down)
	Black: idle
	Green: RX (pulse extended to 1/3 sec)
	Amber: TX (pulse extended to 1/3 sec, takes precedence over RX)
	Green/Amber alternating at 6 Hz: both RX and TX

5) Information Available to the LED Processor

The "pushst" instruction of the LED Processor can push the following
status information, where a 1 indicates true and 0 indicates false:

RX              0x0     Received packet in the last 1/30 sec window
TX              0x1     Transmitted packet in the last 1/30 sec window
COLL            0x2     Collision detected in the last 1/30 sec window
SPEED_C         0x3     MAC is configured for 100 Mbps mode
SPEED_M         0x4     MAC is configured for 1000 Mbps mode
DUPLEX          0x5     MAC is configured for full duplex
FLOW            0x6     Flow control capable
LINKUP          0x7     Link is up
LINKEN          0x8     Link is enabled

The "port" instruction configures the port on which the "pushst"
instruction operates.

The LED Processor is part of the CMIC and has access only to the MACs,
not to the PHYs or other parts of the switch chip.

The latter two values, LINKUP and LINKEN, are not generally available in
all MACs.  For example, the SERDES and Higig MACs have this information,
but the 10/100 MAC does not.

As such, it is recommended that link up/down status and other
user-defined information be passed to the LED Processor by the main CPU,
for example by the linkscan task.

6) Passing Information to the LED Processor

In the Broadcom SDK, memory locations 0x80 through 0x99 in the LED
Processor program data space are reserved for communication from the
host CPU to the LED Processor.  One byte per port has been assigned:

Bit 0 of each byte is used to pass link up/down status.
Bits 1-6 of each byte remain unassigned.
Bit 7 of each byte is used to pass link turbo enable/disable status.

There is no reason this format is required; the user may feel free to
redefine the communication protocol and re-write parts of the driver
code.

Please refer to the file

	$SDK/src/appl/diag/ledproc.c

which demonstrates how to initialize and download the LED Processor, and
how to tie into the linkscan callback routine to send link up/down
status to the LED Processor whenever a link goes up or down.

Note that, as mapped in the CMIC PCI memory space, each byte of the LED
processor occupies an entire 32-bit word, of which only the least
significant eight bits is actually valid.  Therefore, when reading or
writing the LED program or data spaces from the main CPU, the byte
offset must be multiplied by 4 and added to the PCI
CMIC_LED_DATA_RAM_BASE, and 32-bit read/write operations should be used
to avoid any endian issue.  The macros CMIC_LED_PROGRAM_RAM(offset) and
CMIC_LED_DATA_RAM(offset) help calculate these offsets.
