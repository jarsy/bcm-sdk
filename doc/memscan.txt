1) Introduction

The amount of on-chip memory in a switch or fabric chip is rapidly
increasing.  Regardless of how good a memory technology is, the chance
that an alpha particle or similar event causes corruption somewhere in
the chip memory increases linearly with the amount of memory on the
chip, and also increases linearly with the number of chips in the system
(which may contribute more than an order of magnitude in a chassis or
stacking environment).

One possibility is for software to keep a cached copy of the contents of
certain on-chip memories, and periodically compare the contents of the
hardware memory with the cached copy.  If an unexpected mismatch is
found, software can report it is a memory error and update the on-chip
memory with good data from the cached copy.  This is the technique
described in this document.

2) Implementation

A low-level memory caching mechanism already exists in the memory read
and write routines at the SOC layer.  The primary intent for this
caching mechanism is to enhance performance by completely eliminating
memory reads to memories which are eligible for caching.

Our implementation of memory scanning works in conjunction with this
caching mechanism.  This works well because in general, the same
memories that are eligible for caching are also the ones amenable to
software error scanning (see Eligible Memories below), and the memory
spent on the backing store results in the additional performance
benefits of caching.

An optional background task called "memscan" has been added, and is
implemented in soc/memscan.c.  Also, a "memscan" command has been added
to the BCM Diagnostics CLI to start and stop this task with selectable
operating parameters.

When the memscan task is running (a separate one per unit), it
continually scans the contents of any memories for which caches are
enabled.  If a memory error is detected, a message is displayed on the
console at the DK_WARN error level, and the problem is fixed by writing
back good data from the cache.

The configuration parameters are:

* Interval - The period in microseconds between times the scan thread
  wakes up to scan table entries.

* Rate - The number of table entries to scan each time the scan thread
  wakes up.

For example, if the interval is set to 100000 (ten times per second) and
the rate is set to 64, then the task will process a total of 640 entries
per second (64 entries ten times per second).  The amount of time to
scan all memories depends on the total number of entries being scanned,
which in turn depends on which memories have caching enabled.

3) Limitations

There are a number of limitations to this method, some of them severe.
The overall value of enabling software memory error scan is left to the
judgement of the application designer.  By default, the SDK does not use
memory error scanning (or caching).  It should only be used with careful
consideration to the information in this section.

3.1) Memory Consumption

Enabling the caches on a particular memory causes an amount of memory
approximately equal to the size of the on-chip memory to be allocated to
keep the memory backing store.  If there is more than one copy of a
memory on a chip, each copy is cached independently.  Also, if there is
more than one chip attached to the same CPU using caching, this can add
up to a lot of memory.

3.2) CPU Utilization

Performing the scanning consumes CPU cycles.  The amount of CPU
dedicated to this activity is fully adjustable and is dependent on the
Interval and Rate parameters.  Also, the scanning consumes a small
amount of PCI bandwidth.  Also, if there is more than one chip attached
to the CPU using scanning, this can add up to a lot of CPU cycles.

3.3) Latency to Failure Correction

This method will not prevent errors from occurring.  It can only correct
the error some time after it has been detected.

If a memory error does occur, the average latency to detect and correct
it will be one half of the total time required for the scan task to scan
all memories.

During the time the memory error exists, the switching behavior of the
chip may be affected if the chip references the bad location.  A wide
variety of incorrect behaviors could occur during this window.  For
example, if the trunk table were corrupted, packets might be sent to the
wrong port until the error was corrected.

3.4) Eligible Memories

Memories of a "dynamic" nature are ineligible for caching, and also
ineligible for software error correction scanning.

"Dynamic" memories are those that may be updated automatically by the
hardware.  If the software were to attempt to cache these memories,
changes by the hardware would not be visible to the application, or
would be seen as memory errors by the scanning process.

Some examples of dynamic memories include:

* Counter memories, such as those used for Metering

* Memories with hit bits, such as L2, L3, and LPM tables

* Memories with special hardware macro-commands that manipulate the
  memory; for example, Hash Table Insert/Delete.  It would be complex
  to emulate the equivalent behavior in the cache for each case.

* Memories with multiple software "views."  As a theoretical example,
  there might be one physical memory in the hardware, but the same memory
  can be accessed in three ways either as a "left half entry," "right
  half entry," or as a "whole entry."

* Memories with automatic recalculate-on-write parity bits.  Although
  it will work if the parity bits are marked No-Test, most likely such
  errors should be processed by the parity interrupt mechanism instead.

In general, large dynamic memories demand special hardware to achieve
some form of protection.  ECC can be used to eliminate errors, but is
generally too expensive to consider.  Parity allows errors to be
detected, ensures the bad data does not get used for switching, and
often also allows corrective action to be taken by software.

3.5) Disease vs. Cure

In the course of memory scanning over a period of weeks or months, the
CPU could perform trillions of reads and transfer terabytes of data from
the switch chip across the PCI bus.  If the likelihood of a CPU error,
PCI error, or other problem exceeds the likelihood of an actual memory
error occurring, then the cure could be worse than the disease and
scanning would be inadvisable.

Although the SOC software library performs careful locking on accesses
to the memories (MEM_LOCK) by the scan task and accesses by the
switching application, there is a small but non-zero danger a software
bug or race condition could still exist and cause an infrequent crash of
unknown origin.

Some users may wish to use memory scanning for diagnostic purposes.  For
example, it could be enabled on all chips in a chassis during a burn-in
period.

4) Example

The following tutorial shows how to enable and test memory scanning,
and assumes a BCM5690 is being used.

All of the visible memories in the chip can be shown using the "listmem"
command in the diagnostics.  The "C" flag in the Flags column indicates
that the memory is eligible for caching, and therefore also eligible for
software error scanning:

The following command enables memory scanning at a rate of 640 entries
per second.  The actual rate to use is completely up to the application
designer.

BCM.0> memscan interval=100000 rate=64
BCM.0> memscan off		(turns it off -- or can use interval=0)
BCM.0> memscan on		(resumes with previous parameters)

No scanning actually takes place until caching is enabled on the target
memories.  The memory scan task and memory caching can be enabled and
disabled independently and at will without fear of repercussions.  The
following is an example of a randomly chosen set of memories on BCM5690:

BCM.0> cache +egress_mask +gimask +girule +l2mc_table +vlan

Note that only the cached entries are scanned.  On BCM5670, enabling the
caches does not pre-fetch the memories into the cache, so only the
individual entries actually written by software after the caches are
enabled will be scanned.  On BCM5690, enabling the caches uses table DMA
to pre-fetch the contents of the memories into the cache, so all entries
will be scanned immediately after the cache is enabled.

BCM.0> debug +tests     (or "-tests" to turn off)

The test debug flag is used to cause the memscan task to display
debugging information.  Warning: a copious amount of information may be
displayed if the interval is small.  One piece of information the task
will display is the total number of entries being scanned (at the
conclusion of a scan pass).  This may be useful in deciding what
interval and rate to settle with.

There is a secret "nocache" keyword option to the "write" command.  This
option allows one to write into a memory without the cache being
updated.  This can be used to induce a "memory error" for testing
purposes.  In the following example, an "error" is induced in an STG_TAB
entry, and some time later the scan task notices and corrects it.

BCM.0> d raw vlan_stg 100 1
VLAN_STG.arl0[100]: 0x0030d69c 
BCM.0> w nocache vlan_stg 100 1 0x30d68f
BCM.0> [bcmMEM_SCAN.1]Memory error detected on unit 1 in STG_TAB.arl0[100]
[bcmMEM_SCAN.1]    WAS: 0030d69c
[bcmMEM_SCAN.1]    BAD: 0030d68f
[bcmMEM_SCAN.1]    Corrected by writing back cached data

The following example can be used to stress-test the memory accesses on
a Lancelot platform (where unit 0 is BCM5670 and units 1-4 are BCM5690):

BCM.0> *:memscan i=10000 r=256
MemSCAN: Started on unit 0
MemSCAN: Started on unit 1
MemSCAN: Started on unit 2
MemSCAN: Started on unit 3
MemSCAN: Started on unit 4
BCM.0> 0:cache uc mc vid
BCM.0> 1-4:cache def_ip_hi def_ip_lo egress_mask gimask girule ipmc
BCM.0> 1-4:cache l2mc_table l3intf port_mac_block port vlan_stg
BCM.0> 1-4:cache trunk_bitmap port_trunk_egress trunk_group vlan
