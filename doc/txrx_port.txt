(1) Overview

    This document describes how to port from the BCM packet send and
    PMUX APIs to the BCM TX and RX APIs.


(2) Related Documents

    In the directory $SDK/doc, see also txrx.txt and pkt.txt.


(3) The BCM TX API

    The function bcm_tx replaces various versions of bcm_packet_send
    including:

        bcm_packet_send_async,
        bcm_packet_send_ipm_pbmp[_async],
        bcm_packet_send_port[_async], and
        bcm_packet_send_pbmp[_async].

    These have been replaced by bcm_tx and two other functions to be
    described below.

    The bcm_tx API call is simple:

        int bcm_tx(int unit, bcm_pkt_t *pkt, void *cookie);

    Most of the controlling information exists in the bcm_pkt_t
    structure, pkt, and so this structure must be carefully setup
    prior to the bcm_tx call.


(3.1) Allocating the bcm_pkt_t Structure

    In order to call bcm_tx, a bcm_pkt_t structure is required.

    This structure may be on the stack (declared at the beginning of
    the function definition).  Alternatively you may implement a pool
    of TX packet structures to avoid run time allocation, especially
    if asynchronous callbacks are used (see below.)  See
    $SDK/src/appl/cputrans/cputrans.c for an example of this.  Another
    option is to call bcm_pkt_alloc; see below.

    Once allocated the structure itself needs to be properly
    initialized.  If the structure is on the stack, it should be
    zeroed out with a call like sal_memset(pkt, 0, sizeof(bcm_pkt_t));
    Most importantly, the data must be linked into the buffer.  See
    3.2 below.

    The most important data members of the structure include:

        unit      - Physical unit on which the packet will go out.
        cos       - Class of service/queue to associate packet to.
        tx_pbmp   - Port bitmap on which to send packet.
        tx_upbmp  - Untagged ports (subset of tx_pbmp).
        flags     - Indicates which tags are present and CRC choices.
                    Setting to BCM_TX_CRC_APPEND usually works.
        pkt_data and blk_count
                  - These control the data buffer which may exist in
                    multiple segments.  Porting from bcm_packet_send
                    will not require direct manipulation of these.


(3.2) Packet Buffer Allocation and Setup

    Usually, the same data buffer that was used in the bcm_packet_send
    routine can be used with bcm_tx.  If the data was a standard
    tagged ethernet frame going out on FE or non-SL stacked GE ports,
    no changes are required to the data itself.  Other cases are
    discussed below.

    The packet data needs to be linked into the packet structure
    correctly.  The easiest way to do this is with a call to the
    macro:

        BCM_PKT_ONE_BUF_SETUP(pkt, data_buf, length);

        pkt       - Pointer to the bcm_pkt_t structure.
        data_buf  - Data buffer that will be transmitted.
        length    - Number of bytes to be sent from data_buf.

    Note that it may be easiest to do this step last.

    The information in the data buffer should be a standard ethernet
    packet, usually tagged:

         (destination MAC, source MAC, TPID, VLAN tag, ....)

    If the packet will be sent out an XGS fabric chip, care must be
    taken to properly set up the HiGig header information.  See (3.9)
    below for more details.

    bcm_tx supports linking multiple data buffers together to form a
    single packet.  See pkt.txt and txrx.txt for more information.


(3.3) Simultaneous Structure and Buffer Allocation

    When both the packet structure and the data buffer need to be
    allocated, bcm_pkt_alloc may be called:

        pkt_ptr = bcm_pkt_alloc(unit, bytes, flags);

    The unit number may be BCM_UNIT_ANY in most systems.  The
    parameter bytes should be large enough to hold the packet data and
    CRC (and HiGig header if being added manually).

    These packets must be freed by calling

        bcm_pkt_free(unit, pkt_ptr);

    upon completion.

    
(3.4) Asynchronous Transmit Operations

    Asynchronous operations (where the TX call returns immediately and
    a callback is made when the packet has been transmitted) are
    controlled by whether or not the pkt->call_back member is
    non-NULL.

    If you were using a packet send "_async" call, set pkt->call_back
    to the callback function and pkt->cookie to the to desired data
    (passed to the callback).  Otherwise, make certain pkt->call_back
    is set to NULL.

    
(3.5) Setting the Destination Ports

    If bcm_packet_send_pbmp was being used, then the parameter pbm can
    be put into the packet with a call such as

        BCM_PBMP_ASSIGN(pkt->tx_pbmp, pbm);

    Similarly for the untagged bitmap.

    If the packet was being sent to a specific port, try

        BCM_PBMP_PORT_SET(pkt->tx_pbmp, port);

    
(3.6) CRC Settings

    This is a simple matter of setting the packet flags properly.
    Assuming the flags were initialized as desired (probably just to
    0) do the following.

        To append a CRC:     pkt->flags |= BCM_TX_CRC_APPEND;
        To replace a CRC:    pkt->flags |= BCM_TX_CRC_REGEN;


(3.7) Initializing and Configuring the TX API.

    The function bcm_tx_init is called by bcm_init and no further
    initialization or configuration is required.


(3.8) The Fast Path Option

    If:

        A. The packet is setup correctly
        B. No manipulations of the VLAN, SL or HiGig tags is required
        C. the CRC is present in the packet (REGEN may be selected)
        D. No padding of the packet is required

    then the BCM_TX_FAST_PATH flag may be set in pkt->flags.  This
    bypasses various checks and reorganizations required to support
    extra tags.


(3.9) Setting up the HiGig Header

    There are three ways to set up the HiGig header for packets.

    Note for 1 and 2, unless BCM_PKT_F_NO_VTAG is set in pkt->flags,
    the code assumes a VLAN tag is present in the body of the packet.
    This is important in calculating pointers into the packet
    properly.

    1.  [Easiest].  Use the packet structure's members.

        A.  Place the HiGig header information in the appropriate
            packet members such as pkt->opcode, pkt->dest_mod,
            pkt->dest_port, etc.

        B.  Call bcm_pkt_hghdr_setup(pkt) before sending the packet.

        C.  Call the macro BCM_PKT_HGHDR_REQUIRE(pkt) which sets the
            BCM_PKT_F_HGHDR flag.

    2.  Specify the header directly into pkt->_higig.

        A.  Setup the header desired in the 12 byte array pkt->_higig.

        B.  Call the macro BCM_PKT_HGHDR_REQUIRE(pkt) which sets the
            BCM_PKT_F_HGHDR flag.

    3.  Place the HiGig header at the beginning of the data buffer and
        use fast path.  This by passes all other DMA setup processing
        of the data buffer (eg, for padding or CRC allocation).  See
        (3.8), above.

        A.  Setup the header desired in the data buffer.

        B.  Set the BCM_TX_FAST_PATH flag in pkt->flags.


(3.10) Transmitting Multiple Packets

    The function bcm_tx_list allows a linked list of packets to be
    transmitted.  The packets are linked together using the packet
    structure member pkt->next.

    The function bcm_tx_array takes a pointer to an array of packet
    structures, but otherwise operates like bcm_tx_list.

    It is highly recommended that per-packet callbacks NOT be used
    and asynchronous calls be done by passing a single callback to
    bcm_tx_list (or bcm_tx_array).


(4) The BCM RX API

    The BCM PMUX (packet multiplexing) API has been replaced by the
    BCM RX API in SDK 5.0.0.  The RX API uses the same packet
    structure as the TX API.  In addition, it provides greater
    configurability.


(4.1) Comparison Between PMUX and RX

    BCM RX follows the same general philosophy as BCM PMUX.

    Similarities:

        Both control the DMA interface between physical devices and
        the software using the SOC layer.

        Applications register callbacks with a priority.

        Callbacks are executed until one returns either "HANDLED" or
        "HANDLED_OWNED".

        Both require buffer management (allocation/deallocation).

        Both require configuration, initialization and "start"
        operations. 

    Differences:

        RX allows registering in interrupt or non-interrupt mode; PMUX
        had a single switch for all callbacks.

        PMUX required different registration for "info" functions and
        "non-info" functions.  RX always uses the bcm_pkt_t structure
        to pass packet data and meta-data (such as receive port).

        Rate settings for RX are per COS and allow burst settings and
        maximum queue length settings.

        Rate limiting in RX is implemented by a standard token bucket
        mechanism.

        RX provides provisioning of multiple receive channels.

        RX may be integrated with TX more easily.

        RX provides the option of maintaining a buffer pool.

    Although packet buffers may be "stolen" by the application, the
    bcm_pkt_t structures are always owned by RX.  Never deallocate a
    packet structure passed back from RX.

    Packet buffers that are "stolen" by the application should only be
    deallocated by calling bcm_rx_free.
        

(4.2) Initializing and Configuring the RX API

    Because of the greater configurability of the RX API, you may need
    to change the default configuration.  RX is configured using the
    bcm_rx_cfg_t structure in include/bcm/rx.h.

    If you only need to change a few parameters (say the global
    packets/second setting) it is easiest to "get" the current
    settings and make updates before starting RX.

        bcm_rx_cfg_t local_cfg;

        bcm_rx_cfg_get(unit, &local_cfg);
        local_cfg.global_pps = APP_RX_GLOBAL_PPS;
        bcm_rx_start(unit, &local_cfg);

    Alternatively, declare and complete a bcm_rx_cfg_t structure as
    required.  See src/appl/diag/rxmon.c for an example of this.

    Note that each RX channel is configured independently with a
    bcm_rx_chan_cfg_t structure.  It is imporant that all COS values
    be associated with some active channel.

    COS bits are "positive", so the bit must be set for channel to
    accept that COS.  Typically 0xff is used as the cos_bmp.  However,
    if multiple channels are used, a given COS must only be accepted
    by a single channel.


(4.3) Changes to Callback Functions

    First, the callback prototype must be changed to match
    bcm_rx_cb_f:

        bcm_rx_t callback(int unit, bcm_pkt_t *pkt, void *cookie);

    To access the packet data, use BCM_PKT_IEEE(pkt) or
    BCM_PKT_DMAC(pkt) (see (4.6) below).

    The callback must now return one of:

        BCM_RX_NOT_HANDLED     - Continue callbacks
        BCM_RX_HANDLED         - Discontinue callbacks
        BCM_RX_HANDLED_OWNED   - Discontinue callbacks and mark packet
                                 buffer as stolen.

    If the callback returns HANDLED_OWNED, it is responsible for later
    calling bcm_rx_free on the packet buffer.  If the RX Pool code is
    being used (see (4.7) below) the call to bcm_rx_free may be done
    with the data pointer or with pkt->alloc_ptr.  Other restrictions
    may apply if the application sets up a different allocation/free
    mechanism.

    Note that the bcm_pkt_t structure (pkt) may not be "stolen"; only
    the data buffer it points to is controlled when HANDLED_OWNED is
    returned.

    For PMUX, the callback function parameters provided information
    about the packet.  Now that information is included in the
    bcm_pkt_t structure.  These data members of bcm_pkt_t include:

        PMUX           RX             DESCRIPTION
        unit           pkt->rx_unit   The BCM unit number from which
                                      the packet was delivered to the
                                      CPU. 
        source_port    pkt->rx_port   The physical port on which the
                                      packet arrived on rx_unit.
        reason         pkt->rx_reason The reason code (from the SOC
                                      layer) that the packet was sent
                                      to the CPU. 
        packet_length  pkt->pkt_len   The length of the packet data
                                      returned.


    In addition, for XGS, the packet structure contains other
    important information which was not available to PMUX.

        pkt->rx_cpu_cos  - The COS queue in which the packet arrived
        pkt->opcode      - The module header opcode of the packet.
        pkt->src_mod     - The source module ID on which the packet
                           originally ingressed into the system.
        pkt->src_port    - The source port on src_mod on which the
                           packet originally ingressed into the
                           system.
        pkt->dest_mod    - The destination module ID determined at
                           ingress. 
        pkt->dest_port   - The destination port for dest_mod
                           determined at ingress.


(4.4) Registering To Receive Packets

    Like PMUX, applications register a callback, a cookie and a
    priority.  Priorities are between 0 and 255, with 255 being the
    highest priority.

    In addition, flags may be specified to indicate whether the
    callback should be made in interrupt mode and for which COS the
    callback should be made.  It is strongly suggested that
    application callbacks do not register in interrupt mode.

    The COS bits in the flags are "positive", so the bit must be set
    for the callback to be made for that COS.  If no COS is specified,
    a warning will be printed if enabled.


(4.5) Interrupt vs Non-interrupt Context

    If BCM_RCO_F_INTR is set in the flags on a call to
    bcm_rx_register, then the callback will be made in interrupt
    context.  As noted, this is not recommended.  Callbacks occurring
    in interrupt context must use a minimum of execution time, must
    not take a mutex or semaphor and should not attempt to do I/O.

    Usually, a callback will register for non-interrupt context.  RX
    maintains a thread to provide this context and users of a debugger
    or examing the vxWorks task list will see this thread as bcmRX.
    Although not in interrupt context, this thread should not be
    unduly blocked.  Complex operations should steal and enqueue the
    packet and operate in their own context.


(4.6) Received Packet Formats

    As mentioned, RX provides a bcm_pkt_t structure on callback.  This
    structure contains a pointer to the data buffer which can be
    accessed through the macro BCM_PKT_IEEE(pkt) or BCM_PKT_DMAC(pkt)
    which return a (uint8 *) pointer to the first byte of the packet.

    The packet is in standard tagged ethernet format.

        Note: some chips may support alternative tagging formats.
        Currently RX is not aware of these formats and will only
        handle a single VLAN tag.

    Unless otherwise configured, HiGig headers will have been parsed
    into packet members (such as pkt->opcode) and removed from the
    data buffer.


(4.7) The RX Pool Option

    In src/bcm/esw/rx_pool.c is code to manage a buffer pool.  By
    default, this is the pool used by RX and provides the buffers
    returned by bcm_rx_alloc.  To use an alternative allocation and
    free manager, change the rx_alloc and rx_free pointers in the
    bcm_rx_cfg structure before calling bcm_rx_start.

    The pool may be configured by calling bcm_rx_pool_setup before
    calling bcm_rx_start.  Here, the packet size and number of packets
    in the pool may be specified.


(5) Some Examples

    The receive packet test in firmware/orion/src/test/rpacket.c was
    ported to use the TX and RX APIs.  The new code is in
    sdk/src/appl/test/rpacket.c

    Similarly, the traffic test in src/appl/test/traffic.c was ported
    to the TX API.  The code is in the same directories in traffic.c.

    The packet watcher code in src/appl/diag/pcktwatch.c contained
    implementations of both PMUX and RX in SDK 4.2.
