                          Notes on Boot Flags

Several Boot Flags are defined in <krn/boot.h>.

In VxWorks, the Boot Flags are a configuration parameter in the form of
a 32-bit value stored persistently in NVRAM.  The value may be adjusted
in hexadecimal form using the Configuration (c) command in the boot ROM.
VxWorks reserves many of the bits in the Boot Flag value, so the
Broadcom software uses values starting at bit 12 (0x1000).

In Unix, the Boot Flags are derived from a hexadecimal number read from
the environment variable SOC_BOOT_FLAGS.  If the variable is not set,
the default value is 0x22000.

The meanings of the Boot Flags currently available are as follows:

0x1000    BOOT_F_NO_RC          Do not load rc.soc automatically
                                on each StrataSwitch device after
                                once they are all attached.

0x2000    BOOT_F_NO_PROBE       Do not probe the PCI bus for
                                StrataSwitch devices (also implies
                                BOOT_F_NO_ATTACH and BOOT_F_NO_RC).

0x4000    BOOT_F_NO_ATTACH      Do not attach StrataSwitch devices
                                (also implies BOOT_F_NO_RC).

0x8000    BOOT_F_SHELL_ON_TRAP  For VxWorks, when Control-\ is typed,
                                do not reboot as normal, but instead fork
                                a VxWorks shell.  If the main application
                                process dies, this may be useful in
                                getting backtraces using VxWorks commands
                                such as "i" and "tt".

0x10000   BOOT_F_QUICKTURN      Indicates to software that the device is
                                attached to a chip emulator.  The software
                                uses this mainly to lengthen the timeout
                                values on various chip operations.

0x20000   BOOT_F_PLISIM         Indicates to software that the device is
                                attached to a software chip simulator such
                                as pcid or a Verilog model.

0x40000   BOOT_F_48PORT_BOARD   Set to indicate that the software is
                                running on a 48-port integrated design
                                with two StrataSwitch chips back to back.
                                This flag will be obsoleted because all
                                new boards provide a board type and
                                revision ID.

In addition to the Boot Flags, it is possible to set the Boot Script.
In VxWorks, this is another NVRAM parameter that is also set via the
Configuration (c) command.  On Unix, the name of the Boot Script is read
from the SOC_BOOT_SCRIPT environment variable.

If set, the Boot Script is executed with the BCM image boots, after all
devices are probed and attached, but before the rc.soc script is run on
each device.  The Boot Script is only run once regardless of the number
of devices.  The Boot Script must be a .soc file (BCM shell script).
