------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Introduction

This document describes the software support and methodology provided by
the SDK programming libraries to handle Module Identifier mapping in the
XGS environment.

The use of Module Identifier mapping is generally required in any system
that uses BCM5675s and module IDs greater than 31.  For a complete
description of the feature, please refer to the BCM5675 Programmers
Reference Guide.

2) Terminology

The following terms are prerequisite to understanding the programming
guidelines and API calls.

2.1) Switch Device

    XGS switches BCM5650/BCM5655/BCM5665, BCM5673/BCM5674,
	BCM5690/BCM5691/BCM5692/BCM5693, BCM5695/BCM5696/BCM5697/BCM5698.

2.2) Fabric Device

    XGS fabric devices BCM5670/BCM5671, BCM5675/BCM5676.

2.3) Legacy Fabric Device

    Module identifier mapping incapable fabric device like BCM5670.

2.4) Legacy Domain

    An island of legacy fabric devices and switch devices bridged to one
    another only by connection(s) to BCM5675 port(s). For example, in
    the case of a line card with BCM5670 + 2 BCM5690 connecting to a
    fabric  module with BCM5675, BCM5670 + 2 BCM5690 belong to a single
    legacy domain.

2.5) Local Module Identifier (LMODID, LMODID_MAX)

    This is the module identifier programmed in the switch device in
    CONFIG/ICONFIG register.  This is local to the switch device.

    Each switch chip within a legacy domain must be assigned a unique
    LMODID.  For example, a line card with BCM5670+4XBCM5690 should use
    LMODIDs 0..3.

    LMODID_MAX is the maximum LMODID assigned in any legacy domain
    throughout the system.

    LMODID equals 0 for devices directly connected to BCM5675, which is
    often the case.  For each BCM5665, two LMODIDs are required (0 and 1).

    LMODID is the module identifier recorded in various switching tables
    like L2, L3, TRUNK, etc. for referring to switch ports within switch's
    own legacy domain, as opposed to on the other side of a BCM5675 link.

    This is also referred to as 32/64-space module identifier.

2.6) Local Module Port (LPORT)

    This is the zero-based port number used in switching tables in the
    devices part of switch's own legacy domain.  The same appears mapped
    to (SMODID, SPORT) in switching tables on other switch devices not
    part of the switch's own legacy domain in the system;
    see SMODID and SPORT defined below.

    This is also referred to as 32/64-space port number.

2.7) Fabric Module Identifier (FMODID)

    Value 0..127.  A FMODID identifies a switch on the
    translation-capable fabric. Each switch device is assigned a unique
    FMODID.  Each BCM5665 requires two FMODIDs.

    This is also referred to as 128-space module identifier.

2.8) Fabric Module Port (FPORT)

    Value 0..31.  Zero-based port number for all ports on a switch
    device.

    This is also referred to as 128-space port number.

2.9) Switch Module Identifier (SMODID)

    Value (LMODID_MAX+1)..31.  The range can be (LMODID_MAX+1)..63 if
    only BCM5695s switch devices are used in the system.

    Multiple switch devices within a legacy domain should have a unique
    SMODID.  Multiple switch devices across a legacy domain can share
    the same SMODID (for example, two BCM5690 devices or four BCM5673
    devices).  Two legacy devices sharing the same SMODID should have
    a translation capable fabric device (BCM5675) between them.

    SMODID is the module identifier recorded in various switching tables
    like L2, L3, TRUNK, etc. for referring to switch ports outside a
    switch's own legacy domain.

    This is also referred to as 32/64-space module identifier.

2.10) Switch Module Port (SPORT)

    Value 0..31.  This is the port identifier recorded in various
    switching tables like L2, L3, TRUNK, etc. for referring to switch
    ports outside a switch's own legacy domain.

    This is also referred to as 32/64-space port number.

3) Programming Guidelines

3.1) LMODID

    Program the LMODID(s) in each switch device.  This will be a call to
    bcm_stk_my_modid_set(unit, LMODID);  /* LMODID = 0..LMODID_MAX */
    This will set the device module ID in CONFIG/ICONFIG register.

3.2) FMODID

    Assign a unique FMODID for every device in the system after
    determining all the devices.

    It is recommended, but not required, to assign FMODIDs beginning
    with 127 and decrementing, in order to reduce confusion while
    debugging implementations.

3.3) SMODID

    Assign (SMODID, BASE_SPORT) to all devices in the system.  For
    example, two BCM5690/BCM5695 devices attached to the BCM5675
    can share the same SMODID with the base port level-shifted
    suitably.  BCM5695 device 1 could be assigned (SMODID=A,
    BASE_SPORT=0) and BCM5695 device 2 could be assigned (SMODID=A,
    BASE_SPORT=16).  Up to four devices can share the same SMODID as
    long as the sum of number of ports on these devices is <= 32.
    SMODID values assigned must be outside the range of LMODIDs,
    reducing the number of SMODIDs available.

3.4) Switch Device Table Programming

    There are many switch device table programming API calls similar
    to the following which require as input, either through arguments or
    through a structure, a module ID and port pair.  For example:
            bcm_l3_ip_add/delete()
            bcm_l2_addr_add/remove()
            bcm_l2_addr_get()
    In each case, the caller must pass the (SMODID, SPORT) when refering
    to ports outside switch's own legacy domain and (LMODID, LPORT)
    when refering to ports inside switch's own legacy domain
    whenever these API routines call for a module ID and port number pair.
    For systems not using module ID translation,
            FMODID == SMODID and FPORT == SPORT

3.5) Fabric Table Programming

    Program the fabric device using FMODID to set up the crossbar
    tables. This will use existing BCM API like bcm_stk_ucbitmap_set.

4) Compatibility in Mixed Fabric Systems

If only BCM5670 fabric devices are present in the system, no module ID
translation is available and the module ID space is 0..31.

If only BCM5675 fabric devices are present in the system, module ID
translation is available and the module ID space is 0..127.

If both types of devices are present in the system, module ID
translation is available.  There is also a requirement that FMODID be
assigned sequentially to the switch devices, i.e. if LMODID 0, 1, 2, 3
are assigned to switch devices on a legacy Line card then assigned
FMODIDs should be A+0, A+1, A+2 and A+3. The FMODID settings for the
translation capable fabric port to which the Line card connects will be
A.

5) API Function Definitions

This section covers all APIs that have been added or modified to permit
module ID mapping to be programmed.

There are two sets of APIs in SDK5 to control the use of the module
mapping capability that the 5675 provides.

There are a set of fabric related APIs to program the mapping tables in
the 5675 itself (Fabric Configuration), and a set of APIs that control
the software mapping that must be done on the connected switch chips
such as 5695 and 5673 (Switch Configuration).

including enabling the feature and programming the BCM5675 translation

    bcm_stk_modmap_enable_get(int unit,
                      bcm_port_t port, int *enable);

5.2) Switch Configuration

The BCM and BCMX APIs take and return module IDs in the FMOD space
(fabric virtual modids). However, they does not keep internal state to
perform actual translations to and from LMOD and SMOD values.  The
translation is potentially dynamic and hence application-specific.

Therefore, whenever the BCM or BCMX API needs to program a hardware
table with a translated (MODID, port) pair, it calls back to the
application to perform the translation for it.  Conversely, whenever it
reads a (MODID, port) pair from a hardware table, it calls back to the
application to perform a reverse translation.  For example, there are
callout points in the L2, L3, IPMC, Trunk, and Filter APIs.

The switch related mapping APIs are defined in <bcm/stack.h>.  The
following API function prototypes and calls are provided to allow an
application to register a translation routine.

5.2.1) bcm_stk_modmap_cb_t

A single callback is used for forward (SET) and reverse (GET)
translation.  The following declarations specify the required user
callback format.

    #define     BCM_STK_MODMAP_SET      1       /* global to local */
    #define     BCM_STK_MODMAP_GET      2       /* local to global */

    typedef int (*bcm_stk_modmap_cb_t)(int unit,
                                       int setget,
                                       bcm_module_t mod_in,
                                       bcm_port_t port_in,
                                       bcm_module_t *mod_out,
                                       bcm_port_t *port_out);

The setget argument to the callback function indicates in which
direction the mapping should work:

* When BCM_STK_MODMAP_SET is given, the callback is being called
  from an API that is setting values into the switch hardware.
  The mapping is from global space into switch hardware space.

* When BCM_STK_MODMAP_GET is given, the callback is being called
  from an API that is getting values from the switch hardware.
  The mapping is from switch hardware space to global space.

The registered callback must return a BCM_E_XXX error code.  If
BCM_E_NONE is returned, then the mapped module/port pair that are
outputs of the callback are used.  If any other error code is returned,
then the BCM API will set the output module/port pair equal to the input
module/port values (the identity mapping), and will internally propagate
the callback's return value.

The registered callback must implement a mapping that matches the
programming of the attached BCM5675 fabric chip.  It must also handle
translation to/from both LMODID and SMODID spaces, as required.

5.2.2) bcm_stk_modmap_register

The bcm_stk_modmap_register API should be called on each local unit on
each CPU to register a callback.  There can be one mapping function
registered per unit.  The bcm_stk_modmap_register API is not callable
remotely through RPC.

    /*
     * Function:
     *      bcm_stk_modmap_register
     * Purpose:
     *      Register module ID mapping/unmapping callback function
     * Parameters:
     *      unit - SOC unit #
     *      func - User callback function for module ID mapping/unmapping
     */
    int
    bcm_stk_modmap_register(int unit, bcm_stk_modmap_cb_t func);

5.2.3) bcm_stk_modmap_unregister

The bcm_stk_modmap_unregister API should be called on each local unit on
each CPU to unregister a callback.  The bcm_stk_modmap_unregister API is
not callable remotely through RPC.

    /*
     * Function:
     *      bcm_stk_modmap_unregister
     * Purpose:
     *      Unregister module ID mapping/unmapping callback function
     * Parameters:
     *      unit - SOC unit #
     */
    int
    bcm_stk_modmap_unregister(int unit);

5.2.4) bcm_stk_modmap_map

The bcm_stk_modmap_map API is called internally for all translation from
within the BCM API implementation, but it is made available to users of
the BCM API for informational purposes as well.  It is callable remotely
through RPC.

The bcm_stk_modmap_map function takes a module/port pair as input and
produces a mapped module/port pair as output.

In the absence of a user-registered callback for a unit, the
bcm_stk_modmap_map API will set the output module/port pair to the input
module/port pair (the identity mapping) and will return BCM_E_NONE.

    /*
     * Function:
     *      bcm_stk_modmap_map
     * Purpose:
     *      Call module ID mapping/unmapping callback function
     * Parameters:
     *      unit - SOC unit #
     * Notes:
     *      This function is called from within the BCM API implementations
     *      whenever module ID mapping is needed, but it can also be called
     *      by the user application for informational purposes.
     */
    int
    bcm_stk_modmap_map(int unit, int setget,
                       bcm_module_t mod_in, bcm_port_t port_in,
                       bcm_module_t *mod_out, bcm_port_t *port_out)
