		       Notes on L2 Shadow Tables

1. Purpose of L2 Shadow Table

In some applications it may be desirable for ethernet switch software to
keep an L2 (ARL) Shadow Table, which is a copy of the hardware L2 lookup
table in host memory that is kept up to date as closely as possible.

Some possible uses for an L2 shadow table are:

* Software L2 address resolution for packet transmission and ARP lookup

* SNMP "get" and "get next" operations.

* Maintaining synchronized ARLs across multiple chips in a system.

2. StrataSwitch Family

Switch chips including BCM560x, BCM561x, BCM562x, and BCM568x implement
the 8K-entry ARL table as a linear list that is kept in sorted order by
the hardware.

When entries are inserted or deleted, the table is bubbled up and down
as needed.  When entries are looked up, a binary search is used.  The
binary search skips the first entry (index 0) so that only 13 memory
clocks are needed.

For proper operation, it is required that a special static entry be
inserted at initialization time with

	ST=1
	VLAN_TAG=0xffe
	MAC_ADDR=0xfffffffffffe

Without this entry, bad things can happen when the table overflows.
With this entry, new addresses are not learned if the table is full.

Because the hardware changes this table dynamically, software needs to
modify it using special ARL insert and delete S-channel operations
rather than regular memory read/write operations.  It is feasible to use
read/write operations on the ARL only when both hardware learning and
hardware aging are disabled (bcm_l2_freeze).

The hardware performs inserts when learning new addresses, deletes when
processing an aging cycle, and delete/insert pairs when port movement is
detected.

A hardware-assisted ARL lookup operation is provided in BCM560x,
BCM561x, and BCM568x.  In some cases, this may eliminate the need to
maintain an ARL shadow table.

3. ARL DMA

The StrataSwitch family has a feature called ARL DMA.  When this feature
is enabled, a 16-byte record, or "message," is written into host memory
for each hardware ARL insert or delete that occurs.  Transfers are
directed by a base address register that increments and a counter
register decrements each time a message is written.  A four-message
buffer provides time to reload these registers when the count reaches
zero.  Software insertions and deletions are not reflected in ARL DMA.

The StrataSwitch driver ARL Message Task (arlmsg.c) processes messages
as they are received, mirroring them into an AVL tree that is sorted by
VLAN+MAC.  The AVL tree allows for software lookups and in-order
traversals of ARL entries.

One problem with ARL DMA is that the ARL may learn at a rate much faster
than the CPU can keep up with.  If this happens and the buffers fill up,
ARL messages can be dropped.  While this is an unusual situation, it
must be detected and dealt with if it happens.  There are not many
options for recovering in this case.  In the current driver, this is
handled by turning off hardware learning and aging, re-reading the
entire ARL table to resynchronize the shadow table, then restoring
learning and aging activity.

4. XGS Family

In the BCM569x member of the XGS Family, the L2 table is hashed.  This
permits much faster, less complex insert, delete and lookup operations
in hardware.  It is important especially because the table is larger
(16K entries) and much requires much higher lookup bandwidth.

The hardware performs inserts when learning new addresses, deletes when
processing an aging cycle, and delete/insert pairs when port movement is
detected.

A hardware-assisted L2 lookup operation is provided.  In some cases,
this may eliminate the need to maintain an ARL shadow table.  Also, both
software and hardware-assisted versions of the table hash functions are
available.

There is no ARL DMA feature in XGS.  Instead, the StrataSwitch driver L2
Message Task (l2xmsg.c) periodically reads the L2 table and synchronizes
an AVL tree in host memory.  The AVL tree is sorted by VLAN+MAC.  A new
XGS feature called Table DMA is used to read the L2 table in one quick,
efficient operation.

5. Message Callbacks

The AVL tree structure used for storing an L2 shadow table has a
callback feature which can call a user-supplied routine each time an
entry is inserted or deleted in the tree.

This callback feature may be used to pass individual inserts or deletes
to a higher level in the software.  It is ensured that the AVL tree
callbacks will receive a coherent stream of messages; i.e., an eventual
delete will occur for every insert and the number of outstanding inserts
is bounded by the physical entry count.

Because the AVL tree is kept in sync with the hardware, even in the case
of StrataSwitch where ARL DMA messages may be dropped, synchronization
is maintained.  In the case of XGS, a stream of insert/delete messages
is generated from the hash table.
