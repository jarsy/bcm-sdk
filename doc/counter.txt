1. Overview

StrataSwitch counters comprise a set of statistics registers located in
the ingress/egress modules of the StrataSwitch PIC blocks.  For example,
on BCM5600, there are 49 statistics per fast ethernet port and 40 per
gigabit ethernet port, totaling 1256.

The statistics registers have various widths including 12, 16, 20, 24,
and 32 bits.  On the XGS family, all counters are 32 bits except for the
10 gig counters, which are 64 bits.

2. Counter Collection

The StrataSwitch driver implements a counter collection mechanism to
implement 64-bit "virtual," or "software" counters.  The collection
mechanism runs at a programmable interval, performing a periodic
collection cycle.

A collection cycle processes each counter.  For each counter, it:

  1. Reads the hardware counter value.

  2. Subtracts the counter values read during the previous cycle to find
     out the increments since the last cycle.

  3. Takes into account counter overflow wrap-around, a condition which
     applies if the new value is less than the previous value.

  4. Adds the increment to 64-bit software counter values.

  5. Sets a per-counter flag whenever a counter is modified by
     incrementing or clearing.

The driver maintains state in the driver control structure (soc_control)
including the software counter values and counter previous values.

3. Counter Clearing

The software accumulation counters are cleared by simultaneously setting
the hardware and software counters to zero.

The current API actually allows the counter (hardware and software) to
be set to any arbitrary value.

4. Counter DMA

BCM56xx family chips support the automatic, transparent transfer of
counter values directly from the chip into the host CPU memory via DMA.

This is helpful because the numerous counters otherwise have to be read
individually over the S-Channel bus.  Doing so results in a cost to read
all counters from approximately 15 milliseconds (best case with polling
register reads) to 45 milliseconds (interrupt-driven register reads) on
a 200 MHz PPC603 processor.

Counter DMA is a feature of the CMIC.  When counter DMA is active, the
CMIC periodically reads all the counters at an interval selectable from
0 to 1048512 usec in increments of 64 usec.  (If a longer interval is
desired, the software can single-trigger individual counter DMA cycles).

During the counter read process, the CMIC issues S-Channel read
operations to the EPIC and/or GPIC blocks.  The S-Channel access is
properly shared with normal CPU access, with the CPU receiving higher
priority.

After the transfer of all counters is complete, the CMIC interrupts the
driver so the driver can perform counter collection and processing.

5. Counter Thread

When counter collection is enabled in the driver, the driver starts a
counter processing thread.  If requested, it also enables the hardware
counter DMA mode with appropriate parameters and interrupt setup.

When the CMIC sends the completion interrupt, the interrupt handler
wakes up the counter thread, which then performs a collection cycle on
the contents of the DMA buffer.

6. Aliasing effects

Because the software collection process maintains state about the
previous value of a counter, changing the counter value without going
through the Counter API can confuse the collection process.

For example, if the value of a 20-bit counter is changed from 1 to 0,
software has no other choice than to assume the counter has wrapped all
the way around, and therefore it adds 2^20-1 to the software counter
value.

If, for seemingly inexplicable reasons, a counter increments by huge
amounts in the vicinity of 2^20, 2^24, or 2^32, the most likely
explanation is that a counter register is being written to directly.
That might result from invalid use of the BCM "setreg" command, Tcl "soc
setreg" command, or a soc_reg_write() API routine.

Always use a proper API routine to change the value of a
software-maintained counter, such as the BCM "clear counters" command,
Tcl "soc counter <name> <value>" command, or a soc_counter_set() API
routine.

7. Counter API

The driver includes a set of routines for counter management at the
lowest level.  Upper-layer applications (or higher-level APIs such as
the BCM API) should be built on these routines.

Some of the more important routines are described below.  Refer to the
Device Driver Writer's Guide for more information.

7.1. int soc_counter_start(int unit, uint32 flags, int interval, pbmp_t pbmp)

Starts the counter collection thread.  If the flags specify to use
counter DMA, configures the thread to use counter DMA.  A counter
collection is run every 'interval' microseconds.  Counters are collected
only for the ports specified in the pbmp port bitmap.

7.2. int soc_counter_stop(int unit)

Stops the counter collection thread, and cancels counter DMA if in use.

7.3. int soc_counter_get(int unit, soc_port_t port,
			soc_reg_t ctr_reg, uint64 *val)
     int soc_counter_get32(int unit, soc_port_t port,
			   soc_reg_t ctr_reg, uint32 *val)

Returns the value of a specified software counter.  The 32-bit version
truncates the value to 32 bits.  The desired counter is specified by
giving a port and a counter register as defined in socregs
(e.g. TVLANr).  The routine is very fast since it just reads out of a
memory buffer.

7.4. int soc_counter_set(int unit, soc_port_t port,
			 soc_reg_t ctr_reg, uint64 val)
     int soc_counter_set32(int unit, soc_port_t port,
			   soc_reg_t ctr_reg, uint32 val)

Sets the value of a specified software counter.  The desired counter is
specified by giving a port and a counter register as defined in socregs
(e.g. TVLANr).

The routine also sets the hardware counter to the same value, modulo the
counter size, and records it as the previous value so the next read pass
will not register a change.  This routine is primarily used to zero a
counter.

7.5. int soc_counter_set_by_port(int unit, pbmp_t pbmp, uint64 val)
     int soc_counter_set32_by_port(int unit, pbmp_t pbmp, uint32 val)

For each port in the port bitmap pbmp, calls soc_counter_set (or
soc_counter_set32) for each counter associated with that port.

This routine is primarily used to zero all counters for a given port,
group of ports, or all ports (PBMP_ALL).

7.6. int soc_counter_set_by_reg(int unit, soc_reg_t ctr_reg, uint64 val)
     int soc_counter_set32_by_reg(int unit, soc_reg_t ctr_reg, uint32 val)

Calls soc_counter_set (or soc_counter_set32) to set the value of a
specified counter for all applicable ports.

This routine is primarily used to zero a specified counter for all
applicable ports.
