(1) Overview

    This document describes the bcm_pkt_t structure.


(2) Related Documents

    See also $SDK/doc/txrx.txt.


(3) Goals:

    1.  Provide meta-data about a packet such as the source port on
        receive.  This includes the proprietary SL tag and HiGig
        header.
    2.  Support scatter/gather blocks.
    3.  Provide a uniform treatment of packets across both transmit and
        receive.
    4.  Support zero-copy transmit and receive paths.
    5.  Support application specific data through cookies.


(4) Packet blocks

    Data is described by the bcm_pkt_blk_t.  This is simply a pair
    comprised of a data pointer and a length.

        /* BCM packet gather block type */
        typedef struct bcm_pkt_blk_s {
            uint8 *data;
            int len;
        } bcm_pkt_blk_t;

    The bcm_pkt_t points to an array of these structures and has a count
    of the number of elements in the array:
    
        bcm_pkt_blk_t    *pkt_data;     /* Pointer to array of data blocks */
        uint8             blk_count;    /* Number of blocks in array */

    In addition, in order that applications do not need to allocate a
    bcm_pkt_blk_t structure for simple packets with one buffer, the
    bcm_pkt_t structure contains a single block.  This can be setup
    with the macro:

        BCM_PKT_ONE_BUF_SETUP(pkt, buf, len);

    where pkt is a pointer to a bcm_pkt_t structure, buf is a pointer
    to a data buffer and len is the length of that data buffer in
    bytes. 


(5) Packet Macros and Data Members

    Below, pkt is a pointer to a bcm_pkt_t structure.

    BCM_PKT_IEEE_LEN(pkt)
    pkt->pkt_len
        Length of the packet according to its current state.  This
        usually includes the VLAN tag and CRC as well as the MAC
        addresses and other L2 header information.  It does not
        include any proprietary headers such as the SL tag or
        HiGig header.

    BCM_PKT_DMAC(pkt)
        Returns a pointer to dest MAC in pkt as uint8*.

    BCM_PKT_VLAN_PTR(pkt)
        Returns a pointer to the VLAN tag in the packet in network
        byte order.  Note that this may be in the packet data itself,
        or, if the packet is untagged, the information is stored in an
        auxiliary buffer in the packet structure.

    The following BCM_PKT_TAG and BCM_PKT_VLAN macros use the
    BCM_PKT_VLAN_PTR macro, so the notes above apply.

    BCM_PKT_TAG_PROTOCOL(pkt)
        The protocol (eg 0x8100) bytes of the packet in host byte
        order. 

    BCM_PKT_VLAN_CONTROL(pkt)
        The VLAN control tag itself in host byte order.

    BCM_PKT_VLAN_ID(pkt)
    BCM_PKT_VLAN_PRI(pkt)
    BCM_PKT_VLAN_CFI(pkt)
        The VLAN ID, priority and CFI bit respectively extracted from
        the packet (using the BCM_PKT_VLAN_CONTROL

    BCM_PKT_SL_TAG(pkt)
        Returns pointer to the SL tag as uint8*.  Note that this is
        not in the packet data, but in an auxiliary buffer in the
        packet structure.  The tag is in network byte order.

    BCM_PKT_HG_HDR(pkt)
        Returns pointer to the HiGig Header as uint8* Note that this
        is not in the packet data, but in an auxiliary buffer in the

    BCM_PKT_HAS_HGHDR(pkt)
        Boolean:  Should the packet be treated as having a HiGig
        header according to the flags in the packet?

    BCM_PKT_HAS_SLTAG(pkt)
        Boolean:  Should the packet be treated as having an SL tag
        according to the flags in the packet?

    BCM_PKT_NO_VLAN_TAG(pkt)
        Boolean:  Should the packet be treated as NOT having a VLAN
        tag according to the flags in the packet?

    The following data members provide access to HiGig or SL tag
    information:
    
        pkt->src_mod, pkt->src_port, pkt->dest_mod, pkt->dest_port
            The source and destination module ID and port numbers that
            indicate the system ingress and egress ports.

        pkt->cos
            The COS queue in which the packet is transferred.

        pkt->opcode
            The opcode byte that appears in the HiGig header.

                BCM_HG_OPCODE_CPU    CPU bit is set
                BCM_HG_OPCODE_UC     Unicast frame
                BCM_HG_OPCODE_BC     Broadcast frame
                BCM_HG_OPCODE_MC     Multicast frame
                BCM_HG_OPCODE_IPMC   IP multicast frame

	    The Higig opcode must be set appropriately when sending
            unicast, broadcast, multicast, or IPMC packets from a
            fabric chip.  The BCM_HG_OPCODE_CPU is used to send to the
            CPU on an adjacent fabric chip.

    The following members are receive specific:

        pkt->rx_reason
            Provides a bitmap of reasons a packet was forwarded to the
            CPU.

        pkt->rx_port, pkt->rx_unit
            The packet was received from a specific unit and port.
            These indicate which.  Note that this may be different
            than the system ingress port.

        pkt->rx_cpu_cos
            When forwarded to the CPU, a packet may be sent on a
            different COS queue.  This indicates that remapping.

    The following members are transmit specific:

        pkt->tx_pbmp, pkt->tx_upbmp, pkt->tx_l3pbmp
            Transmit port bitmaps.  May be directly manipulated or
            indirectly with a call to bcm_tx_pkt_l2_map (to be
            implemented).

            To send broadcast or multicast packets from a switch chip,
            just include all the destination ports in the port bitmap
            and include the appropriate MAC DA in the packet data.

        pkt->call_back, pkt->cookie, pkt->cookie2
            Callback and two cookies for user.  Note that the decision
            to send a packet synchronously or asynchronously is made
            by examining whether or not call_back is NULL.  If
            call_back is non-NULL, the packet is sent asynchronously.

    Other data members in the packet:

        pkt->pkt_len
            See BCM_PKT_IEEE_LEN above.

        pkt->unit
            The local unit number on which the packet is to be sent on
            for TX.

        pkt->tot_len
            The actual number of bytes received (for example,
            including the HiGig header which may have been stripped
            from the data buffer.)

        pkt->flags
            State flags
            BCM_PKT_F_HGHDR          Does the packet have a HiGig tag?
            BCM_PKT_F_SLTAG          Does the packet have an SL tag?
            BCM_PKT_F_NO_VTAG        Is the packet lacking a VLAN tag?

            Action flags
            BCM_TX_CRC_ALLOC         Allocate space for CRC on TX.
            BCM_TX_CRC_REGEN         Regenerate the CRC on TX.
            BCM_TX_CRC_APPEND        Append CRC (allocate + regenerate).
            BCM_TX_NO_PAD            Don't pad runt packets.
            BCM_TX_FAST_PATH         Raw packet ready to transmit.

            BCM_RX_CRC_STRIP         Don't include CRC in length of an
                                     RX pkt.

        pkt->next
            User level "next" pointer for linked lists of packets.
            This pointer may be used by the BCM RX layer before
            packets are sent to applications.  So the data in this
            pointer should only be used when the application "owns"
            the packet.

    Although scatter/gather is supported, the following is ASSUMED:
        MAC addresses, the VLAN tag and the CRC do not span
        bcm_pkt_blk_t boundaries.

    The following functions provide access to the data in the packet.
    These may not be efficient.

    uint8 *bcm_pkt_byte_index(bcm_pkt_t *pkt, int n, int *len,
                                 int *blk_idx);
        Returns pointer to the n-th byte in the packet.  Sets len to
        the number of bytes remaining in the gather block of that
        byte.  If blk_idx is non-NULL, it gets the index of the gather
        block in which the byte indexed resides.

    int bcm_pkt_memcpy(bcm_pkt_t *pkt, int dest_byte, uint8 *src, int len)
        Copies len bytes from the src buffer into the packet in
        existing allocation units.  Returns the number of bytes
        actually copied into the packet which may be less than len if
        the packet does not have sufficient space in its buffer.


(6) Packet manipulation macros and functions

    BCM_PKT_NO_VTAG_REQUIRE(pkt)
        After this macro is called, the packet will be treated as
        though it has no VLAN tag in the data buffer.  However, note
        that the hardware requires a VLAN tag internally.  To send a
        packet out untagged, manipulate the untagged port bitmap.

    BCM_PKT_HGHDR_REQUIRE(pkt)
        After this macro is called, the packet will be treated as
        having a HiGig header.  This should only be used for BCM 5670
        and related units.  For other XGS devices, the HiGig header
        information is transferred in the DMA control words, not added
        to the packet buffer data.
            NOTE that the HiGig header is never a part of the packet,
        but is maintained separately.

    BCM_PKT_SLTAG_REQUIRE(pkt)
        After this macro is called, the packet will be treated as
        having an SL tag.  This should only be used when the system is
        running in the SL stacking mode.  In this case, all packets
        received by and sent by the CPU should have an SL tag.
            NOTE that the SL tag is never a part of the packet, but is
        maintained separately.

    bcm_pkt_hghdr_setup(bcm_pkt_t *pkt)
        Setup the HiGig header to be consistent with the data members
        in the packet such as src_port and src_mod (see above).  This
        should be called before bcm_tx for packets that have a HiGig
        header.

    bcm_pkt_hghdr_extract(bcm_pkt_t *pkt)
        Extract the HiGig header data into the packet's members such
        as src_port and src_mod (see above).  This is called by RX on
        packets that have a HiGig header before application callbacks
        are called, so pkt->src_mod, etc. are properly set for the
        application.

    bcm_pkt_sltag_setup(bcm_pkt_t *pkt)
        To Be Implemented.
        Setup the SL tag to be consistent with the packet's data
        members.  This should be called before bcm_tx when the
        system is in SL stacking mode.

    bcm_pkt_sltag_extract(bcm_pkt_t *pkt)
        To Be Implemented.
        Extract the SL tag data into the packet's data members.  This
        is called by RX on packets that have an SL tag before
        application callbacks are made.
