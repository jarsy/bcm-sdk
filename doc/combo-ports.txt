                Notes on Copper/Fiber Combination Ports
                 Curt McDowell, Broadcom Corp. 11-27-02
                         Last Updated: 02-18-04
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Combination Ports

Combination (combo) ports are those which support more than one medium
type, such as copper and fiber, on the same switch port.  Of course,
only one medium type may be active at a time because they share the same
switch port.

1.1) PHYs Supporting Combo Ports

The BCM5421S, BCM5461S and BCM5464S are PHYs which support copper/fiber
combo ports.  Boards using these PHYs can be built with gigabit ports
that simultaneously have an RJ45 and fiber module, or an RJ45 and a
GBIC.

These PHYs also support automatic detection of signal/energy on each
medium.  A user can plug or unplug either medium type and the PHY (and
software driver) can automatically switch the medium type.  In case both
medium types are active, one medium is selected based on a configurable
priority, the default being fiber.

1.2) Automatic Medium Selection

Automatic medium selection is optional.  Ports may also be forced to one
mode or the other by the application using the API calls to disable the
inactive medium (this enable value is provided in the bcm_phy_config_t
structure as discussed later).

If only the copper side is plugged in, the combo port driver will detect
it and link up copper.

If only the fiber side is plugged in, the combo port driver will detect
it and link up fiber.

If both sides are plugged in, only the medium that is configured as the
'preferred medium' (see below) will link up.

If fiber is the preferred medium and linked up, then plugging and
unplugging the copper side will not have any effect on the fiber side.

If copper is the preferred medium and linked up, then plugging and
unplugging the fiber side will not have any effect on the copper side.

1.3) Port Signal/Energy Detect Considerations

It is important to note that certain situations may result in link
behavior that does not seem intuitive, but is unavoidable.  These cases
are discussed individually below.

1.3.1) Auto Medium with Fiber Preferred

In Auto Medium mode with Fiber Preferred, when fiber link is active the
copper TX is powered down to prevent false link on copper remote link
partner.

When the fiber link is inactive, both fiber and copper TX are enabled to
permit selection of interface that has receive energy.  This allows
connection between two Auto Medium combo ports.  Medium selection is
based on receive energy, and the link partner TX provides this.  To
enable an Auto Medium combo port to connect properly to another Auto
Medium combo port, the TX energy to the remote link must be active.

Fiber TX energy is always active to permit an Auto Medium combo port to
connect to another Auto Medium combo port.

1.3.2) Auto Medium with Copper Preferred

In Auto Medium mode with Copper Preferred, when the copper link is
active the fiber autonegotiation is not active.  This prevents false
link on the fiber remote link partner.  However, the fiber TX may
provide energy to remote link partner and result in false link if
autonegotiation is disabled on remote link partner.

When the copper link is inactive, both fiber and copper TX are enabled
to permit selection of interface that has receive energy.  The BCM5464
will be in pass-through mode to permit fiber interface to perform
autonegotiation.  This allows connection between two Auto Medium combo
ports.  Medium selection is based on receive energy, and the link
partner TX provides this.  To enable an Auto Medium combo port to
connect properly to another Auto Medium combo port, the TX from the
remote partner should be active.

Copper TX energy is always active to permit an Auto Medium combo port to
connect to another Auto Medium combo port.

1.3.3) Copper Forced Mode

In this mode the fiber interface should be inactive.  However, a fiber
link partner with autonegotiation disabled may still see link up due to
energy provided by the fiber interface.

1.3.4) Fiber forced mode.

In this mode, only the fiber interface is active.  The copper TX is
powered down to prevent false link up on copper link partner.

2) Control Properties

The soc_property mechanism is used to make certain driver configurations
related to the combo ports.  Please see the sal_config_set()/get() APIs
and the $SDK/rc/config.bcm configuration file.

As with all port-based properties, the property name can be suffixed
with an underscore and a port number.  If it is, the property will only
apply to a single port.  The suffixes are:

        _feX            Zero-based FE port number X
        _geX            Zero-based GE port number X
        _xeX            Zero-based 10-GE port number X
        _hgX            Zero-based Higig port number X
        _portY          One-based switch port number Y (any port type)

Also as with all port-based properties, the property name can be
suffixed with a period (.) and a SOC unit (device) number.  If it is,
the property will only apply to that specific unit.  The unit number
suffix, if any, must come after the port suffix.  See below for
examples.

2.1) General

2.1.1) phy_5690

If a port is wired directly from a BCM5690 to a fiber module and there
is no external PHY, no property setting is needed.  The code in
phyident.c will detect that there is no external PHY and automatically
default to direct-attached fiber.

However, on the 24-port 5690 SDK boards there is a 5434 or 5464 PHY and
there is a resistor stuffing option that can be used to bypass the PHY
or not.  Please refer to the SDK user guide and schematics for more
information.

Even if the PHY is bypassed, it is still present on the MDIO bus and the
software will be fooled into trying to use it.  To get around this, set
the following property so that the probing procedure in phyident.c will
ignore the PHY detected on the MII bus and assume a direct connection
from BCM5690 to the fiber module:

        phy_5690_ge10=1
        phy_5690_ge11=1

2.1.2) phy_automedium

If the PHY is to be used in automatic medium selection mode, the
following properties should be used (example assumes a 5690 with three
attached 5464s):

        phy_automedium_ge8.1=0
        phy_automedium_ge9.1=0
        phy_automedium_ge10.1=1
        phy_automedium_ge11.1=1

For 5464, the default is off (0).  See phy_5464S property.
For 5464S, the default is on (1).  See phy_5464S property.

2.1.3) phy_fiber_pref

If the PHY is used in automatic medium selection mode, then the priority
medium is selected to be fiber or copper by setting the phy_fiber_pref
property.

If the PHY is NOT used in automatic medium selection mode, then this
property indicates the fixed fiber or copper operation mode of the PHY
(example assumes a 5690 with three attached 5464s):

        phy_fiber_pref_ge8.1=0
        phy_fiber_pref_ge9.1=0
        phy_fiber_pref_ge10.1=1
        phy_fiber_pref_ge11.1=1

For 5464, the default is copper (0).  See phy_5464S property.
For 5464S, the default is fiber (1).  See phy_5464S property.

2.1.4) if_tbi

This property applies to any PHY used in TBI mode.  The BCM5421S may be
used in TBI + fiber mode but not TBI + copper mode.  See comments in the
PHY driver for more information (example assumes a 5645 with two
attached 5421s):

        if_tbi_ge0.0=1          (Or if_tbi_port25.0=1)
        if_tbi_ge1.0=1          (Or if_tbi_port26.0=1)

TBI is a deprecated mode and GMII should be used instead.

2.2) BCM5464S

The following properties apply specifically to BCM5464S.

2.2.1) phy_5464S

If the PHY is a BCM5464S, then this property must be set.  This is
because 5464 and 5464S have the same PHY ID and the software can not
determine the chip type from the PHY ID alone.  For example, if ports 9
through 12 on unit 1 are 5464S, the properties should be set as:

        phy_5464S_ge8.1=1
        phy_5464S_ge9.1=1
        phy_5464S_ge10.1=1
        phy_5464S_ge11.1=1

It is necessary to declare all four ports of a Quad PHY as 5464S so that
the errata workarounds execute correctly for certain revisions.  If
5464S is being used for copper only, this property is actually
unnecessary since 5464S is a superset of 5464.  Automedium must be
disabled for 5464/5464S to work as copper-only, otherwise a floating
fiber-detect input pin could cause the port to switch to fiber mode.

2.3) BCM5421S

The following properties apply specifically to BCM5421S.

2.3.1) phy_fiber_deglitch_usecs

Some problematic GBICs may cause a brief fiber energy detect signal when
inserted, even without a link.  If fiber is the preferred medium, this
could cause the copper link to be dropped temporarily.

For ports with this issue, an energy detect de-glitch is provided.  The
property phy_fiber_deglitch_usecs may be set to the de-glitch time in
usec.  The PHY driver ignores transitions of the Energy Detect signal
from false to true unless they are present for at least the number of
microseconds specified by this property.

        phy_fiber_deglitch_usecs_ge0=2000000
        phy_fiber_deglitch_usecs_ge1=2000000

2.4) Recommended settings

2.4.1) 24-port 5690 SDK with Fiber-Direct resistors

On these boards, unit 1 can be configured so the last two ports of the
last quad-PHY (ports 11 and 12) bypass the 5434/5464 PHY device.

In this configuration, the settings are

        phy_5690_ge10.1=1
        phy_5690_ge11.1=1

In this case the 5434/5464 drivers are not used for those ports and the
internal SERDES driver (phy5690) is used instead.

2.4.2) 24-port 5690 SDK with all ports copper 5434 or 5464

In this configuration, no settings are necessary.  The default will be
copper on all ports.

2.4.3) 24-port 5690 SDK with ports 23 and 24 as 5464 combo ports

If the boards are configured without Fiber-Direct (as above) then the
last two ports of the last quad PHY may be used as forced copper or
fiber, or automedium detection.

2.4.3.1) Forced Copper or Fiber

The phy_5464S property needs to be set to tell the driver that the last
quad PHY is a 5464S.  However, the first two quad PHYs can be left as
5464 even if they are 5464S without causing any problem.  This is
because the 5464 is a subset of the 5464S.  Also, if they are not left
as 5464 you would have to set phy_automedium and phy_fiber_pref
properties explicitly for them.

It is necessary to declare all four ports of a Quad PHY as 5464S so that
the errata workarounds execute correctly.

        phy_5464S_ge8.1=1
        phy_5464S_ge9.1=1
        phy_5464S_ge10.1=1
        phy_5464S_ge11.1=1

        phy_automedium_ge8.1=0
        phy_automedium_ge9.1=0
        phy_automedium_ge10.1=0
        phy_automedium_ge11.1=0

        phy_fiber_pref_ge8.1=0
        phy_fiber_pref_ge9.1=0

        phy_fiber_pref_ge10.1=0 # Use this for forced copper
        phy_fiber_pref_ge10.1=1 # Use this for forced fiber

        phy_fiber_pref_ge11.1=0 # Use this for forced copper
        phy_fiber_pref_ge11.1=1 # Use this for forced fiber

2.4.3.2) Automatic Medium Selection

Note that automedium actually defaults to 1 for 5464S, so it must be
explicitly turned off for ports 9 and 10.  In automedium mode, the
phy_fiber_pref property determines which medium to use if BOTH media are
active.

        phy_5464S_ge8.1=1
        phy_5464S_ge9.1=1
        phy_5464S_ge10.1=1
        phy_5464S_ge11.1=1

        phy_automedium_ge8.1=0
        phy_automedium_ge9.1=0
        phy_automedium_ge10.1=1
        phy_automedium_ge11.1=1

        phy_fiber_pref_ge10.1=0 # Use this to prefer copper
        phy_fiber_pref_ge10.1=1 # Use this to prefer fiber (default)

        phy_fiber_pref_ge11.1=0 # Use this to prefer copper
        phy_fiber_pref_ge11.1=1 # Use this to prefer fiber (default)

3) Medium Configuration Parameters

Medium Configuration Parameters include:

    enable              PHY enable state
    preferred           True if the medium is the preferred one
    autoneg_enable      Autoneg enable state
    autoneg_advert      Advertisement values for when autoneg is enabled
    force_speed         Forced speed for when autoneg is disabled
    force_duplex        Forced duplex for when autoneg is disabled
    master              Master/slave mode for 1000TX
    mdix                Auto-MDIX setting

These configuration parameters are kept in a bcm_phy_config_t structure
(same as soc_phy_config_t at the SOC layer).

Combo PHY drivers keep one set of configuration parameters per medium
type.  When the PHY callouts, and correspondingly the bcm_port API
calls, are used on the combo port, only the set of parameters for the
active medium are updated.

Whenever the medium type changes, the driver's link_get routine restores
the set of parameters corresponding to the new media type.

Each combo PHY driver has a medium_config_set/get routine.  The BCM API
calls bcm_port_medium_config_set()/get() API calls can be used to
retrieve, modify, and write back this set of parameters, on a
per-medium-type basis.

It is not necessary to deal with the parameters for multiple medium
types if not desired.  Instead, a medium change callback can be
installed using the bcm_port_medium_status_register()/unregister() API
calls to be notified of a change in medium type.  The callback occurs
after the saved parameters are restored to the PHY, hence the user's
callback routine may overwrite any of the parameters if any changes are
needed.

4) Diagnostics 'combo' command

The 'combo' command reveals the bcm_port_medium_config_set()/get() API
calls (see below for more detail) to the diagnostics command shell.  The
command allows access to the parameter set that is maintained for each
media type.  Parameters can be viewed and updated, even for the media
which are not currently active.  The combo command also shows the
currently-active medium type.

Usage (COMBO): Parameters: <ports> [copper|fiber [<option>=<value>]]
        Display or update operating parameters of copper/fiber combo PHY.
        Note: the 'port' command operates on the currently active medium.
        Example: combo ge1 fiber autoneg_enable=1 autoneg_advert=1000,pause

4.1) Displaying the combo port medium configuration

For example, on a dual-BCM5690 combo SDK, the 23rd and 24th front panel
ports are combo ports.  These correspond to 5690 unit 1, ports 11 and 12
(numbering from 1).  Thus, the following command displays the settings
for the 23rd front panel port:

  BCM.1> combo 11
  Port 11 BCM5464:
      Copper:
          enable=1 preferred=0 force_speed=1000 force_duplex=1
          autoneg_enable=1 autoneg_advert=100,10,pause(0xc0f) master=Auto
     *Fiber:
          enable=1 preferred=1 force_speed=1000 force_duplex=1
          autoneg_enable=1 autoneg_advert=1000full,pause(0xc20) master=None

Here, the fiber connection shows as currently active.

The command "combo 11 fiber" displays only the fiber information for the
same port while the command "combo 11 copper" displays only the copper
information, for example:

  BCM.1> combo 11 fiber
  Port 11 BCM5464:
     *Fiber:
          enable=1 preferred=1 force_speed=1000 force_duplex=1
          autoneg_enable=1 autoneg_advert=1000full,pause(0xc20) master=None

4.2) Changing the combo port medium configuration

When the 'port' command is used to modify a port parameter, the medium
parameters corresponding to the active medium are updated.

When the parameters for the active medium are changed using the 'combo'
command, they are immediately reflected in the PHY (possibly causing a
link down and re-autonegotiation).

If the parameters are changed for an inactive medium, they will not take
effect until that medium becomes active.  The 'combo' command is the
only way to change parameters for an inactive medium.

Any of the parameters shown in the combo port status display can be
changed simply by specifying the changes on the command line as
"parameter=value", for example:

  BCM.1> combo 11-12 fiber autoneg_enable=0
  BCM.1> combo 11-12 copper autoneg_enable=1 autoneg_advert=1000full,pause
  BCM.1> combo 11-12 copper autoneg_enable=1 autoneg_advert=100,10
  BCM.1> combo 11-12 copper preferred=1; combo 11-12 fiber preferred=0

When setting the autoneg advertisement the port mode is parsed from the
following list:

    String      soc_port_mode_t         Equivalent string
    ------      ---------------         -----------------------
    full        SOC_PM_FD               1000full,100full,10full
    half        SOC_PM_HD               1000half,100half,10half
    1000        SOC_PM_1000MB           1000full,1000half
    1000full    SOC_PM_1000MB_FD        1000full
    1000half    SOC_PM_1000MB_HD        1000half
    100         SOC_PM_100MB            100full,100half
    100full     SOC_PM_100MB_FD         100full
    100half     SOC_PM_100MB_HD         100half
    10          SOC_PM_10MB             10full,10half
    10full      SOC_PM_10MB_FD          10full
    10half      SOC_PM_10MB_HD          10half
    pause       SOC_PM_PAUSE            pause_tx,pause_rx
    pause_tx    SOC_PM_PAUSE_TX         pause_tx
    pause_rx    SOC_PM_PAUSE_RX         pause_rx

5) Using the PHY drivers

5.1) Debug Messages

To save space, the phy5421S.c and phy5464.c drivers incorporate debug
messages into the binary only if compiled with

        #define DPRINTF_ENABLE          1

This is the default.  If debug messages are compiled in, they will
display only when DK_PHY is enabled (from the BCM command line:
"debug +phy").

Additional debugging information is displayed when DK_VERBOSE is
enabled.  Generally, this is the information from routines which are
called on every iteration of linkscan, such as the link_get and
media_check routines.  This can result in a lot of output.  It may be
useful to run linkscan at a slow rate (such as
"linkscan interval=5000000" for every 5 seconds).

5.2) Medium control functions

BCM API support for multiple media types is available in releases SDK
4.2.3 and later although this informational file was not updated in SDK
4.2.3.

5.2.1) Medium types

The medium types are enumerated as bcm_port_medium_t:

        BCM_PORT_MEDIUM_NONE
        BCM_PORT_MEDIUM_COPPER
        BCM_PORT_MEDIUM_FIBER

5.2.2) Medium Status Retrieval

The routine to determine whether the current port is currently operating
in fiber or copper mode is:

        int bcm_port_medium_get(int unit,
                                bcm_port_t port,
                                bcm_port_medium_t *medium);

The current medium is also available in the bcm_port_info_t structure
that is retrieved by bcm_port_info_get()-type API calls.

The current medium is also available on each link up event, in the
bcm_port_info_t structure that is passed to callback routines registered
with the linkscan task via bcm_linkscan_register().

5.2.3) Medium Configuration Retrieval

The medium configuration parameters for a specified port and medium type
may be retrieved all at once using the following API routine:

        int bcm_port_medium_config_get(int unit,
                                       bcm_port_t port,
                                       bcm_port_medium_t medium,
                                       bcm_phy_config_t *config);

Please see the if_combo() routine in diag/if.c for example usage.

5.2.4) Medium Configuration Update

The medium configuration parameters for a specified port and medium type
may be updated all at once using the following API routine:

        int bcm_port_medium_config_set(int unit,
                                       bcm_port_t port,
                                       bcm_port_medium_t medium,
                                       bcm_phy_config_t *config);

For best operation, it is recommended that the caller use
bcm_port_medium_config_get(), then update the required fields in the
configuration structure, then use bcm_port_medium_config_set().

This API will update the parameters for a specified medium even if the
medium is not active.  If the active medium is updated, the changes will
take effect immediately, which may cause autonegotiation to restart.

Please see the if_combo() routine in diag/if.c for example usage.

5.2.5) Medium Status Change Callback

A callback is available for when the active medium type changes.
Whenever the active medium type changes, the configuration parameters
for the new medium type are written to the PHY, and then the callback
(if any) is made.

If desired, this callback could be used to reprogram port parameters
(via the bcm_port API) and potentially override the values written by
from the medium configuration structure.  In fact, the entire concept of
multiple sets of parameters per medium could be ignored, although we do
not prefer that be done.  The problem is that a medium may link up after
the medium change, but before the application is notified via callback.
Then link may go back down and up when the application adjusts the
parameters.

The type for the callback routine is:

        typedef void (*bcm_port_medium_status_cb_t)
                (int unit,
                 bcm_port_t port,
                 bcm_port_medium_t medium,
                 void *user_arg);

extern int bcm_port_medium_status_unregister(
    int                          unit,
    bcm_port_t                   port,
    bcm_port_medium_status_cb_t  callback,
    void                        *user_data);

The routine to register a callback function is:

        int bcm_port_medium_status_register
                (int unit,
                 bcm_port_t port,
                 bcm_port_medium_status_cb_t callback,
                 void *user_arg);

The routine to unregister a callback function is:

        int bcm_port_medium_status_unregister
                (int unit,
                 bcm_port_t port,
                 bcm_port_medium_status_cb_t callback,
                 void *user_arg);

The callback and user_arg must also match when unregistering.  Only one
function may be registered at a time.
