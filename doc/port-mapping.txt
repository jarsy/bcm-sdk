(1) Background

In most cases the physical port numbers used internally in a switch
chip are different from the port numbers used in the silk screen on
the actual switch hardware. The switch software needs to provide some
kind of abstraction in the user interface that hides the internal port
numbers and associates each front panel port with a logical port name.

When dealing with port numbers in the SDK it is important to
understand how a front panel port is referenced depending on the
context.

Pin Group Port Number

A front panel port is connected to a group of pins on the switch chip,
and the port number here is called the the pin-group port number.
Typically these numbers are tied to a port type and are named GE1,
GE2, XG1, etc. These names can be found in the pin list in the
datasheet.

Physical Port Number

Within the register programming interface each port is referenced by a
physical port number.  The physical port number is typically used in
register address calculations and for indexing memory tables and port
bitmap fields in registers and memories.  The physical port number is
always relative to the switch chip ID aka the unit number.

System Port ID

In order to support a stacking environment any port within the stack
can be identified by a module ID and a module port number.  The module
ID is assigned to a switch device through the register programming
interface, whereas the module port number in most cases has a fixed
relation to the physical port number.  The important thing to
understand is that the physical port number and the module port number
may be different for a particular port.  The System port ID is
typically used when programming the switching tables and trunks.


(2) Diag Shell Port Mapping

By default the diag shell (aka the BCM shell) uses a simple port
number abstraction that divides the ports into classes (fe, ge, hg,
etc.) and assigns a zero-based sequential number to the ports within
each class. For example, Fast Ethernet ports are named fe0, fe1,
etc. and HiGig ports are named hg0, hg1, etc. The symbolic port names
are translated to physical port numbers before any calls are made to
the BCM API.

Historically the above port naming convention would assume that the
internal port numbers are in the same order as the front-panel ports,
but this is not necessarily the case for some newer XGS chips such as
the BCM56624 chip. The result is that it has become increasingly
difficult to associate a port name in the BCM shell with a front-panel
port number.

The BCM shell has been expanded to use a more flexible port naming
system based on an individual mapping of each internal port. The
default port mappings are designed to match the Broadcom reference
designs, but the port mappings can be changed either through function
calls or configuration settings.

For the basic user interface the BCM shell uses the following macros:

  DPORT_TO_PORT(unit, dport)

    This macro translates a diag shell  port number to an 
    internal port number.

  DPORT_FROM_PORT(unit, port)

    This macro translates a diag shell port number to an 
    internal port number.

  DPORT_PBMP_ITER(unit, pbmp, dport, port)

    This macro iterates over a port bitmap (as used by the
    BCM API) in dport order, which may be different from
    the bit order in the port bitmap.

Consider the following example port mapping:

    Shell  Internal
     1        0
     2        3
     3        1
     4        2

From this we get:

  DPORT_TO_PORT(1) = 0
  DPORT_TO_PORT(3) = 1

  DPORT_FROM_PORT(1) = 3
  DPORT_FROM_PORT(3) = 2

  DPORT_PBMP_ITER(unit, 0xe, dport, port)
    1st iteration: dport = 2, port = 3
    2nd iteration: dport = 3, port = 1
    3rd iteration: dport = 4, port = 2


The following new configuration parameters (shown with their default
value) are supported:

  dport_map_enable=1

    Enable diag shell port mapping. Port names will be assigned in 
    dport order, and the BCM shell will list multiple ports in
    dport order regardless of the internal port numbering.

  dport_map_indexed=1

    Port names for each port type (fe, ge, etc.) will increment
    by one starting at zero, e.g. if a switch has four xe ports
    with dport numbers 24, 25, 26, and 27, they will be named
    xe0, xe1, xe2, and xe3. In non-indexed mode the ports would
    be named xe24, xe25, xe26, and xe27.

  dport_map_direct=0

    Traditionally, specifying a raw number instead of a port name
    in the diag shell will be parsed as if port numbers are counted
    from 1 up to the number of enabled ports. Typically this would
    mean that for a gigabit switch, port 1 would correspond to ge0,
    and so forth. Setting this flag causes raw port numbers to be
    parsed as internal port numbers.

  dport_map_port_<port>=<dport>

    Map dport number <dport> to internal port number <port>.


(3) BCM API Port Mapping

A particular problem arises when a design replaces an older switch
chip with a newer pin-compatible switch chip.  The register
abstraction provided by the BCM API combined with pin-compatibility
should ideally make the application migration from the old to the new
device straight-forward, however, if the API port maps are different
between the old and the new device, many application functions will
break.

In order to address such differences in the API port maps, the BCM API
supports port remapping within the API itself.  As an example it is
possible to make the port map of a BCM56620 device look like the port
map of a BCM56504 device.

By default BCM API port mapping is not compiled into the SDK
libraries.  To enable this feature, the following setting must be
added to Make.local:

CFGFLAGS += -DINCLUDE_BCM_API_XLATE_PORT

Several pre-configured port translation maps are provided for
convenience, otherwise a translation map must be built from scratch.
In both cases the configuration is done through config variables.

To use a pre-configured translation map, e.g. BCM56620 to BCM56504,
the following configuration variable must be added:

bcm_xlate_port_map=bcm56620_to_bcm56504

The example below shows a custom mapping that maps physical port 2 to
BCM API port 0:

bcm_xlate_port_2=0

To manually map BCM56620 to BCM56504, the following config variables
must be added:

bcm_xlate_port_2=0
bcm_xlate_port_3=1
bcm_xlate_port_4=2
bcm_xlate_port_5=3
bcm_xlate_port_6=4
bcm_xlate_port_7=5
bcm_xlate_port_18=6
bcm_xlate_port_19=7
bcm_xlate_port_14=8
bcm_xlate_port_15=9
bcm_xlate_port_16=10
bcm_xlate_port_17=11
bcm_xlate_port_26=12
bcm_xlate_port_32=13
bcm_xlate_port_33=14
bcm_xlate_port_34=15
bcm_xlate_port_35=16
bcm_xlate_port_36=17
bcm_xlate_port_46=18
bcm_xlate_port_47=19
bcm_xlate_port_27=20
bcm_xlate_port_43=21
bcm_xlate_port_44=22
bcm_xlate_port_45=23
bcm_xlate_port_28=24
bcm_xlate_port_29=25
bcm_xlate_port_30=26
bcm_xlate_port_31=27
bcm_xlate_port_0=28

The new port namespace created by this mapping applies to physical
port numbers only, and it is normally called the API port number
space.

When BCM port mapping is active it is essential that an application
always uses the bcm_port_gport_get API for translating an API port
number into a system port ID (e.g. when adding an L2 address to the
ARL table), even if the switch is not a member of a stack.


(4) Additional Information

The commands in the BCM shell will translate the logical port names
(ge0, etc.) into either a physical port number or an API port number
depending on the context.  For example any direct register access
(getreg, etc.) will always use physical port numbers whereas BCM
commands (vlan, etc.) will use API port numbers.

Use the pbmp command to see how a logical port name is translated into
a physical port and API port number respectively:

  pbmp ge0
  pbmp bcm ge0
